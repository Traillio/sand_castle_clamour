# sand_castle_clamour

Had a really fun time making this project. Learned a bit about makefiles and blender along the way.

There is alot of rushed code in here ( ;  
  -There is no error handling for any resources  
  -Comments are scarce  
  -Some classes are bloated  
  -There is some code duplication  
  -Some bad variable/function names  
  -A few magic numbers  
  -Mixing c and c++ often  
  
Regrets:  
  -Did not make a Transform class
